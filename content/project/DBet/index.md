title: DBet
summary: DBet is a decentralized application implemented in Solidity that allows users to perform sport bets on the blockchain. In this way there are no third-party bookmakers, meaning that the user doesn’t leak personal information and also he doesn’t lose the margin. If a gambler wins enough bets, he can buy (with a special token that will be presented later) some fancy NFTs that he can then sell on the market for ETH.
