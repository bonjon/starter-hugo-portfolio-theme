title: Ro.Bo.
summary: The goals of that project were the automatic rigging of a human body from a picture and animate it. First of all we take a picture and create a 3D model thanks to PIFUHD, after we rig it with RigNet and finally animate it with a script in Panda3D. It was a group project and I've worked in particular in the part where we create the 3D model and rig it.
